Implement a catalog viewer for a collection of images.

Frontend Tech: React, Typescript, Material UI

Requirements:

The catalog shows the first image with its details (Random text) on right when opened.
Clicking on the previous or next button displays the previous or next image with details respectively.
Clicking the next button when the last image is showing should display the first image(cycling).
Clicking the previous button when the first image is showing should display the last image(cycling).
There will be a play/pause icon button which should alternately start and stop the automatic display of images in the carousel. Begin with the currently displayed image and display the images for a 3 second interval. Clicking on any carousel indicator or the previous or next button when the slideshow is active loads the appropriate image and the slideshow continues from that image
Clicking on any thumbnail should show that image with details.
The currently selected thumbnail image should be highlighted and others should be in grayscale.
